2738\. Number Guessing Game
===========================

## Problem code: GUESSING

Here is the rule of the game: The computer generates a number from 000000 to 999999, and you should guess the number.  
Everytime, the computer will tell you the count of all i from 0..5 that `guess[i]==target[i]` (A). And the count of all (i,j) from (0..5,0..5) that `guess[i]==target[j]&&i!=j` (B).
