4408\. Build a Fence
====================

## Problem code: FENCE1

There is a wall in your backyard. It is so long that you can¡¦t see its endpoints. You want to build a fence of length L such that the area enclosed between the wall and the fence is maximized. The fence can be of arbitrary shape, but only its two endpoints may touch the wall.  

## Input

The input consists of several test cases.  

For every test case, there is only one integer L (1&lt;=L&lt;=100), indicating the length of the fence.  

The input ends with L=0.  

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing the largest area. Your answer should be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point.  

## Example

### Input:
1  
0  

### Output:
0\.16
