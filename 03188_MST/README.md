3188\. Minimum Spanning Tree
============================

## Problem code: MST

Find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.  

## Input

On the first line there will be two integers N - the number of nodes and M - the number of edges. (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000), (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100000)
M lines follow with three integers i j k on each line representing an edge between node i and j with weight k. The IDs of the nodes are between 1 and n inclusive. The weight of each edge will be &lt;= 1000000.  

## Output

Single number representing the total weight of the minimum spanning tree on this graph. There will be only one possible MST.  

## Example

### Input:
4 5  
1 2 10  
2 3 15  
1 3 5  
4 2 2  
4 3 40  

### Output:
17
