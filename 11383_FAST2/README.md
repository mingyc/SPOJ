11383\. Fast Sum of two to an exponent
======================================

## Problem code: FAST2

There is people that really like to do silly thinks, one of them is sum the numbers from 2^0 to 2^n, task is actually really simple, just do a ultra fast sum of term 2^0 to 2^n  

## Input

the first line starts with a number, T, wich is the number of test cases, T lines will follow  

each line contains a number "n" that is the nth term of the sum from 2^0 to 2^n  

0&lt;=n&lt;=500  

## Output

Output the sum from 2^0 to 2^n MODULO 1298074214633706835075030044377087  

## Example

### Input:
3  
0  
1  
2  

### Output:
1   
3   
7   

### Extra: TLE is equal to 0.15s
