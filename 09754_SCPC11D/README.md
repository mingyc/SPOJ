9754\. Egypt
============

## Problem code: SCPC11D

A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 had a right angle as its largest angle. You must determine if other triangles have a similar property.  

## Input

Input represents several test cases, followed by a line containing 0 0 0. Each test case has three positive integers, less than 30,000, denoting the lengths of the sides of a triangle.  

## Output

For each test case, a line containing "right" if the triangle is a right triangle, and a line containing "wrong" if the triangle is not a right triangle.  

## Example

### Input:
6 8 1025 52 606 8 10  
25 52 60  
5 12 13  
0 0 0  
5 12 130 0 0  

### Output:
right  
wrong  
right
